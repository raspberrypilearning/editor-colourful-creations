## Challenge: Create a poster

Designers often create a 'palette' of colours that work well together for a particular theme such as desert or space. 

Can you create a new Python project that uses a dictionary for a themed colour palette. You could choose autumn, forest, sea, Christmas, ice cream, the colours of your favourite sports team or an idea of your own. 

Create a poster using your colour palette dictionary.

You can also use other turtle commands that you know such as `forward`, `right`, `left`, `penup` and `pendown`. 

Maybe you could add a border to your poster?

Other useful turtle commands:

+ `circle(50)` draws a circle outline with radius 50.
+ `dot(100)` draws a filled in circle with diameter 100. 
  
Here's an example:
