### Why use a dictionary?
Using hex colour codes is really flexible, but they are hard to remember. A dictionary can map memorable colour names to hex colour codes.
</div>

Add the code below to create a dictionary for your colours. 


<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 6
line_highlights: 7-9
---
colours = {  # Name of dictionary
  'verylime': '#A7E30E',  # colour name : hex code
  'reallyraspberry': '#BF3F7F'
}
--- /code ---
</div>
--- task ---
Try adding your own colours. You can add your own hex codes and invent names to match.

### Tip

You need a comma `,` between each item that you list in the dictionary. 
</div>
